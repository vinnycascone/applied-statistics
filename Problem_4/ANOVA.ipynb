    "\n",
    "In this exercise, I generated three independent samples, each of size \\(n = 30\\), from normal distributions with true means 0, 0.5, and 1. Because these populations differ in their means, I expect statistical tests to detect these differences.\n",

    "\\[\n",
    "H_0: \\mu_1 = \\mu_2 = \\mu_3.\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "ANOVA compares the amount of variation **between groups** to the variation **within groups**. In this simulation, the ANOVA typically yields a small p-value (p < 0.05), indicating that the observed differences among the sample means are too large to be explained by sampling variability alone. Thus ANOVA rejects the null hypothesis and concludes that **at least one** population mean is different from the others.\n",
    "\n",
    "The three independent t-tests examine pairwise comparisons:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Sample 1 vs Sample 2 (difference ≈ 0.5)\n",
    "- Sample 1 vs Sample 3 (difference ≈ 1.0)\n",
    "- Sample 2 vs Sample 3 (difference ≈ 0.5)\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the true differences are moderate or large, the t-tests involving the largest mean difference (1 vs 3) almost always show a significant result. The comparisons involving smaller differences (0 vs 0.5, and 0.5 vs 1) may or may not be significant depending on sampling variability. Overall, the t-tests are generally consistent with the ANOVA result, though ANOVA provides a single unified test while the t-tests give pair-specific conclusions.\n",

    "### 2. Why ANOVA Is Preferred Over Running Multiple t-tests\n",
    "\n",
    "While t-tests can be used to examine specific pairwise differences, using several t-tests to compare multiple groups creates a serious statistical problem. Each t-test conducted at the \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\) level has a 5% chance of producing a false positive (Type I error). When multiple t-tests are performed independently, the probability of making **at least one** false positive grows rapidly:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "\\text{FWER} = 1 - (1 - \\alpha)^k,\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "where \\(k\\) is the number of comparisons.  \n",
    "With three groups, there are \\(3\\) pairwise t-tests, and the overall false-positive rate exceeds 14%.  \n",
    "With four groups, this grows to over 26%.  \n",
    "This inflation of the familywise error rate makes uncorrected multiple t-tests statistically unreliable.\n",
    "\n",
    "ANOVA solves this problem by:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Performing a single global test** that evaluates all means simultaneously while keeping the Type I error rate fixed at \\(\\alpha\\).\n",
    "2. **Separating the analysis into two steps**:  \n",
    "   - First, determine whether any differences exist (global ANOVA).  \n",
    "   - Only if significant, follow with post-hoc tests (e.g., Tukey, Bonferroni) that properly control for multiple comparisons.\n",
    "3. **Using all data efficiently** by pooling variance estimates across groups rather than estimating variance separately for each t-test.\n",
    "4. **Scaling well as the number of groups increases**, unlike the rapidly growing number of pairwise t-tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, while both ANOVA and t-tests can detect differences between means, **ANOVA is the correct first step** whenever more than two groups are compared because it maintains statistical validity and prevents inflated false-positive rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "ANOVA provides a statistically sound, global assessment of whether group means differ, and should always be used before conducting any pairwise comparisons. The subsequent t-tests can help identify which groups differ, but without ANOVA and proper correction, multiple t-tests would lead to invalid inference due to inflated Type I error.\n"
